PeaceBot: The AI that never fights at Orbis Challenge 2015


PeaceBot doesn't like conflict. He just wants to sip his coffee and enjoy his new book, and he wanders why all the other AIs simply won't leave him alone.

Install the Orbis2015 package from the website https://www.orbischallenge.com/ and copy the file PlayerAI.py into the directory Orbis/Python/botplayer and watch him run away from all the other robots. Setup instructions can be found in the package under Game Manuel.
